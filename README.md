# Bootcamp Project 1

First Bootcamp project for Group 10:

- Pawel Bzinkowski
- Milena Tessari Zanqui
- Daniel Colman

The requirement of the project is to conceive and execute a website design that solves a real-world problem by integrating data received from multiple server-side API requests.

The website has to meet the following requirements:
Use Bootstrap.

- Be deployed to GitHub Pages.

- Be interactive (in other words, accept and respond to user input).

- Use at least two server-side APIs Links to an external site..

- Use modals instead of alerts, confirms, or prompts.

- Use client-side storage to store persistent data.

- Be responsive.

- Have a polished UI.

- Have a clean repository that meets quality coding standards (file structure, naming conventions, best practices for class/id naming conventions, indentation, quality comments, and so on).

- Have a quality README (including a unique name, description, technologies used, screenshot, and link to the deployed application).
